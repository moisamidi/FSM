# FSM
my day simulation:)

This code represents a simulation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) that simulates my day. The FSM has several states such as sleeping, cleaning, eating, studying, playing, coffee_cigaretts, rollerskating + transitions between these states based on random events and conditions.
